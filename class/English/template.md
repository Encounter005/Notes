From the sharp/marked decline/ rise in the chart, it goes without saying that **\_\_\_\_**.

There　are　at　least　two　good　reasons accounting for **\_\_**. On　the　one　hand, **\_\_\_\_**. On　the　other　hand,　**\_\_\_** is　due　to　the　fact　that **\_\_\_\_**.　In　addition, **\_\_\_\_** is　responsible　for **\_\_\_**.　Maybe　there　are　some　other　reasons　to　show **\_\_\_\_**.　But　it　is　generally　believed　that　the　above　mentioned　reasons　are　commonly convincing.
